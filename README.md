# ETL-project
ETL project for advanced python course with GSG (Gaza Sky Geeks)

## Now, At east we know what shall we do:
- Read and try how to read csv file in python (without pandas)
- After reading, think about structure, do we need to check it ? every time or what do
you think ?
- Check Empty and Duplicated rows
- Based on the number of columns in the header, you are supposed to generate new
file with the needed columns. For example if the header has (num_cols:5) â†’ means your
output file will have 5 processed and clean columns
